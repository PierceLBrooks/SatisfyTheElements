Wow, I love this emo-rap band! | happy
Or maybe they'd prefer trans-punk? | smile
Post-grunge-trans-metal-punk?
Anyhow, glad you decided to come.
So ...
question
So, how'd you hear of this band? | happy | +2 | Someone commented on my MySpace Blog who'd thought I'd like it.
What are you talking about? This band is trash. | smile | +2 | Haha, yeah, but like in a good way.
Do you come here often? | grossed_out | -1 | Never.

This place is known for its trash bands. I'm surprised you hadn't heard of it. | grossed_out
question
I have, actually. I own the place. | grossed_out | -3 | Capitalist pig.
Me too. | happy | +3 | Hella.
I know you are but what am I. | surprised | +0 | No, you.

So ... what's a question you'd ask on a first date? | smile
question
Why are your eyes so damn beautiful? | grossed_out | -3 | I'm not giving you the satisfaction of a response to that one.
Who's your top SoundCloud rapper? | blushing | +4 | You are. I love your rendition of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow"; it's got such a grungy flavor.
You want kids? | surprised | +1 | Not sure that's a good first date question. |
happy | You should have your own meme page.

I guess the only decent first date question I can think of is if you pronounce it "gif" or "jif". | happy
question
"Gif" | happy | +3 | That's good.
"Jif" | anger | -6 | I'm not sure we should even try this if that's what you think.

Well, what do you want to talk about?
question
I'd be happy to just stare into your eyes the rest of the night. | grossed_out | -4 | Uhm. I'd rather not.
I don't know. | smile | +2 | Hella. 
I mean, there's some shit going down in the Middle East right now? | anger | -1 | Uh, pass.
How do you get your hair to stay like that? | happy | +2 | Static electricity; I prefer to consider myself more of a thunderstorm elemental than one of just air.

I'll use my fakie to get us some drinks. What do you want?
question
Blue Hawaiian | surprised | -1 | Whoa. Wasn't expecting that. 
Moscow Mule. | happy | +3 | Good choice, that's what I'm having.
Whatever you're having. | smile | +1 | I hope you like Moscow Mule. No take backsies.
Maybe you shouldnt use a fake id.... | surprised |-2| Fine, I'll use my real one.

Here's yours. | smile
You know, I'm really glad you came today.
Hey, I wanna ask you something.
Do you like Hot Topic?
question
Haha, no way. Poser central. | happy | +4 | Yeah, I guess so. I'll go in there now and again for skinny jeans and that's about it.
Yeah! Where do you think I got this sick My Chemical Romance shirt? | anger | -3 | You mean someone didn't barf on you on the way here? |
smile | Haha. Epic.

Well, now that the band's done we should probably go. The management doesn't like people sticking around here after a certain hour. What did you think of them?
question
Pretty alright. No Werid Al or anything, just alright. | smile | +2 | Understandable, nothing like Amish Paradise, amirite?
Great! You have the best taste in music! This was epic! | anger | -4 | Wow, you don't have to lie just to make me feel better. I know you hate post-grunge-trans-metal-punk!
Shit. | happy | +4 | l o l epic

Well, nice to meet you. | smile
