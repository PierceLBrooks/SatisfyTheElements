This project was created over a period of 48 hours for the Shawnee State University (http://shawnee.edu/) game development club (_GDoS) Fall semester jam of 2018.
Progress was streamed on Twitch at the following URL: https://www.twitch.tv/piercelbrooks
The primary dependency is SFML (https://www.sfml-dev.org/).
This is a dating simulator game. The jam's theme was "Satisfying Elements". We decided to interpret that guideline quite literally.
Here is a little tagline: "Satisfy The Elements is about helping some romantically distraught elementals find their way to love through the dating service you work for!"
We only built this for a Windows 10 machine. It should theoretically work on most other modern platforms, though. There is an example build included from our active environment.
Enjoy!
